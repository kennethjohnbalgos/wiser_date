= Wiser Date for Rails

WiserDate is a date formatting plugin written by Kenneth John Balgos (https://github.com/kennethjohnbalgos). Wiser Date features dynamic presentation of feed timestamps. Right now, it only displays the date statically. I'm writing the jQuery scripts to update the displayed dates in real-time and dynamic.


== Installing Gem

    gem "wiser_date"
    

== Dependency

Rails >=3.1 and jQuery >=1.7 to make the real-time feature work.


== Using the javascripts - Not Yet Available

Require jquery.wiser_date in your app/assets/application.js file.

    //= require jquery.wiser_date


== Usage

Use the wiser_date function in your views.

    <%= wiser_date @user.last_login_at %>
    # Sample display within few seconds: just now
    # Sample display within few minutes: about 30 minutes ago
    # Sample display within the day: about 15 hours ago
    # Sample display after the day: yesterday 12:21pm
    # Sample display after 2 days: Sept 10, 2013 12:21pm
    
@user.last_login_at can be any timestamp you want to display.

Assume that the value is "Mon, 10 Sept 2012 12:21:16 UTC +00:00".


== Options & Examples

You can customize the behavior of the date display by using the following options:

* *date_format* - overrides the default date format [default: "%b %d, %Y"]
    
    <%= wiser_date @user.last_login_at, :date_format => "%Y-%m-%d" %>
    # Sample display within few seconds: just now
    # Sample display within few minutes: about 30 minutes ago
    # Sample display within the day: about 15 hours ago
    # Sample display after the day: yesterday 12:21pm
    # Sample display after 2 days: 2012-09-10 12:21pm

* *time_format* - overrides the default time format [default: "%l:%M%P"]
    
    <%= wiser_date @user.last_login_at, :time_format => "%H:%M:%S" %>

    # Sample display within few minutes: about 30 minutes ago
    # Sample display within the day: about 15 hours ago
    # Sample display after the day: yesterday 12:21:16
    # Sample display after 2 days: Sept 10, 2013 12:21:16

* *humanize* - converts date to more readable string [default: true]
    
    <%= wiser_date @user.last_login_at, :humanize => false %>
    # Sample display within few seconds: Sept 10, 2013 12:21pm

    <%= wiser_date @user.last_login_at, :time_first => true %>

    # Sample display within the day: about 15 hours ago

    <%= wiser_date @user.last_login_at, :custom_class => "date_tooltip" %>

    <%= wiser_date @user.last_login_at, :time_now => "2012-09-10 12:21:16 +0000" %>
